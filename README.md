# Challenge Collective

Challenge Collective
Competetive, decentralized motivational SmartContract with a little gambling component

**We want to incentive people to learn more and become their best self** 
- Self improvement + Gambling + Social Competition

To play our game you simple need to join a Challenge Collective gaming pool, submit your ETH and hit your daily targets:

if you miss your targets, the cash goes to the rest of the pool. 
In the end of the game the prize fund will be split with those who are left in the game.

[View our UI demo](https://challenge-collective.herokuapp.com/)
- Please not the UI demo requires users to have a duolingo account + metamask installed
- we ask users to change their duoling name to match their metamask pub address - this is so we can verify that they own that duoling account.

* from here the user will be able to join a game (front-end not connected yet)
