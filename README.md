# Challenge Collective

Challenge Collective
Competetive, decentralized motivational SmartContract with a little gambling component

**We want to incentive people to learn more and become their best self** 
Self improvement + Gambling + Social Competition

To play our game you simple need to join a Challenge Collective gaming pool, submit your ETH and hit your daily targets:

if you miss your targets, the cash goes to the rest of the pool. 
In the end of the game the prize fund will be split with those who are left in the game.
